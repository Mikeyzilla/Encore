Hello everyone who's reading my Encore README!
This app was made by me, Mike.

I wanted to go above and beyond for this project. Add in all sorts of features and gizmos to my core idea of a two-way marketplace app but for music. 
This app, although currently in progress (very early stages of development), will be based around the core idea of "Managers looking for bands to hire for their shows / concerts / festivals" and 
"Bands looking for venues / events they can be a part of". As a manager, your flow will be as follows: Click on a genre -> see the bands that make music in that genre -> click on a band you're interested in 
-> Find out more info about the band, with the option to send them a message and start the negotiation process.

As a band, your flow will be as follows: Create your band profile -> view the calendar hub that will contain all event details per day (where the event is, what type of event it is, what time slot is it for,
who the manager is, and how much they're offering) -> if you like an offer, you can send out a message to the manager saying you're interested. If not interested, just keep searching. As bands, you can also go into your inbox to see messages sent to you by managers, who are looking to start that negotiation process.

Right now, you can create your account and login as either a manager, experienced band, or inexperienced band. You can also go in (if you go directly to /genrelist) and click on a genre, find all bands by that genre, and if you are interested in a band, click on that band's sneak peek to be taken to their profile page. 

There are a ton of features I'm going to implement for this, like JWT, location filtering (only show bands within X miles of the venue), a band-specific analytics dashboard that shows up on their profile (tells how the band's sales have gone within the past year), overlap functionality for events, an inbox messaging system, and so much more. I'm going to try and make this as real of an app as possible. 

Thanks for reading,
Mike
